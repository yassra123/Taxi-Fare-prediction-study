# Taxi-Fare-prediction-study
Linear Regression prediction model - Data Analysis project


The purpose of this Data Analysis project is to build a model that predicts Taxi fare before the ride begins.
This is done by building a linear regression model that predicts fare_amount, based on mean_distance and mean_duration having the most weight in the prediction.



The model performance is high on both training and test sets, suggesting that there is little bias in the model and that the model is not overfit. In fact, the test scores were even better than the training scores.
For the test data, R2 is 0.868 means that 86.8% of the variance in the fare_amount variable is described by the model.
